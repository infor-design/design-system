# Design Tokens

Design tokens are metadata about a visual design system. The tokens within Infor Design System describe different attributes and values that you'll find within the UI of Infor applications. Design tokens enable a system for consistent visual style attributes across diverse platforms and technology.

For more about using design tokens, see [design.infor.com](https://design.infor.com) or checkout our [simple example](EXAMPLE.md).
