# Using Source Sans Pro for Infor Design System

To read more about how to use Source Sans in IDS, see our [Typography guidelines](https://design.infor.com/guidelines/identity/typography).

Mac users should install the OTF version by going into `/font/OTF/` and installing all variants into Font Book.

## Source Sans Pro

Source Sans Pro is a set of OpenType fonts that have been designed to work well
in user interface (UI) environments. In addition to a functional OpenType font, this open
source project provides all of the source files that were used to build this OpenType font
by using the AFDKO makeotf tool.
